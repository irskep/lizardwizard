Morp, a young apprentice to the aging Lizard Wizard Edrick, was woken in his sleep by his master.

EDRICK: Morp! Wake!

MORP: Nnng? Wh?

EDRICK: The rascal Fredward has stolen Wikipedia!

EDRICK: He fed its pieces to his Magic Brain Flies and set them loose in the Perlin Caves.

MORP: Why do you care?

EDRICK: I've been using Wikipedia for years to look up spells. Why do you think I don't own spellbooks?

EDRICK: There's only one thing to do.

EDRICK: I'm too old to go exploring, so you must venture into the caves yourself.

EDRICK: Eat the flies you find to absorb their knowledge. Then come to me and we'll put the information back into the system.

EDRICK: I can sense the general area of the flies that ate each article. I will tell you where to search for them.

---

EDRICK: There are three spellbooks in this part of the cave.
