MORP: Nnng? Wh?

EDRICK: Come, Morp. It is time for your trials.

MORP: Trials? What trials?

EDRICK: You are nearly ready to becom a Lizard Wizard. Now you must go on the Apprentice's Surprise Quest.

MORP: Why is it a surprise?

EDRICK: Because I just love surprises!
EDRICK: For other people.

EDRICK: You will go into the Perlin Caves in search of enlightenment in three forms:

EDRICK: Mastery of the Feet
EDRICK: Mastery of the Tail
EDRICK: and Mastery of the Tongue.

EDRICK: You will find an artifact for each form of enlightenment. Bring them back.

EDRICK: Did you get all that?

MORP: I think so. To the caves!
